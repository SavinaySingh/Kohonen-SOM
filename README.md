# Self-Organizing Map (SOM) Project

This project implements a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) neural network using Python and NumPy. SOMs are unsupervised neural networks used for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization of high-dimensional data.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project environment, run the following bash script:

```bash
sh environment-setup.sh
```

## Usage

- Activate the virtual environment:  
  `source .venv/bin/activate`

- Run Jupyter Notebook:  
  `jupyter notebook`

- Open the SOM notebook and start experimenting.
